To run the local server, navigate into the quiz_site folder. Then in the CMD Prompt type [ python manage.py runserver ]
To ensure the most recent static files (such as CSS or JS) have been uploaded to the deployed version of the site, use: [ python manage.py collectstatic ]
To reset the PK sequence (especially after a large amount of data is added locally) use the following command in psql to avoid an IntegrityError - do this for every database table:
[ SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('app_dbtable', 'id'), coalesce(max(id), 1) + 1, false) FROM app_dbtable; ]

 [ python manage.py makemigrations ] 
 [ python manage.py migrate ]
